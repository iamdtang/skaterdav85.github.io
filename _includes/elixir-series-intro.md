For the past 10 years, my programming experience has mostly focussed on
JavaScript and PHP. I've learned a few functional programming concepts
through JavaScript, such as function purity, immutability, and side effects,
but I've never worked with a true functional language. To learn more about functional programming, I've decided to learn
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and blog about my journey.
