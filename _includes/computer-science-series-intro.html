My academic background wasn't computer science. If you're like me, you've probably been asked an algorithm question in an interview and had to stumble your way through it. I've been there. Nowadays, there are many companies that don't ask algorithm questions in interviews, which begs the question, should you learn them? For a lot of web developer jobs, you probably won't use them much, if at all, with the exception of the occasional interview. However, as I'm learning them, I'm finding algorithms to be a fascinating topic and worth learning for the intellectual stimulation.

The goal of this series is to cover traditional computer science topics through the lens of JavaScript.
