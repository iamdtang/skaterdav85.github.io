This assignment will use Laravel and the [chinook SQLite database](http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/).

All Laravel assignments, labs, and class demos will build on the same installation.


## Submission

Please push up your code including the database to GitHub to the same repository as last week (__itp405-laravel-assignments__). You should already have connected your GitHub repository to Heroku for automatic deployments. If you haven't, [follow these instructions](/tutorials/deploying-laravel-with-sqlite-to-heroku). Verify that your app has been deployed and it works on Heroku. Send an email to me and the TA with the repository URL and the URL to the live site on Heroku.
