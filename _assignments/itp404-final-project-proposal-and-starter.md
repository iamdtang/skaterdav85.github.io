title: ITP 404 Final Project Proposal and Starter

## Project Proposal

Create a new Ember application. Delete the contents in the README and write a paragraph about your application addressing the following questions:

1. Who is the primary audience?
2. What problem are you trying to solve?
3. How will the [project requirements](/assignments/itp404-final-project) be fulfilled?

Also briefly state what your API endpoints will look like for each of the 4 HTTP methods, including the URLs, request payloads, and response payloads.

## Start Your Project

Create at least 2 routes and add the HTML structure of the app such as the header, navigation, sidebar, footer, etc. Style it. Try and tackle as much of the app layout as you can so that over the next few weeks you can focus on the JavaScript/Ember and building the API.

## Submission

Create a repo on Github called __itp404-final-project-frontend__ and upload your files. Send an email to the TA and myself with the Github URL. As always, assignments are due the following Tuesday at midnight.
