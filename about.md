# About

Hi, I'm David Tang. I'm a software developer from Los Angeles currently working at Verizon Digital Media Services, an Oath company, building CDN analytics applications with Ember.js.

I'm the author of this blog and the book [Ember Data in the Wild](https://leanpub.com/emberdatainthewild).

I also [teach](/teach) web development courses part-time at USC to students from all backgrounds.

Outside of my tech life, I play in a few adult ice hockey leagues and enjoy traveling the world.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iamdtang) or email me at david@thejsguy.com.
