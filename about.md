# About Me

Hi, I'm David Tang. I'm a software developer from Los Angeles currently working at [Oath - Verizon Digital Media Services](https://www.oath.com), building rich, client-side applications with Ember.js. I am passionate about building long-lived web applications driven by tests with great user experiences.

I'm the author of this blog and the book [Ember Data in the Wild](https://leanpub.com/emberdatainthewild).

I am also a part-time lecturer at USC, [teaching web development courses](/teaching) to students from all backgrounds.

Outside of my tech life, I play ice hockey and I enjoy checking out new vegan restaurants and traveling the world.
