# About Me

Hi, I'm David Tang. I'm a product-focussed software engineer from Los Angeles currently working at [Verizon Media](https://www.verizonmedia.com/). My expertise is in web technologies, particularly JavaScript. I have lots of experience with Ember, Ember Data, and JSON:API. I believe in building products that deliver business value. I also value testing, convention over configuration, and embracing standards.

My passion lies on the front-end building great user experiences, but I also have professional experience on the backend working with PHP, Laravel, Node, and relational databases.

I am the author of the book [Ember Data in the Wild](https://leanpub.com/emberdatainthewild) and the SitePoint video course [Test-Driven Development in Node.js](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/master-test-driven-development-in-node-js-2932).

I am also a part-time lecturer at the University of Southern California, [teaching web development courses](/teaching) to students from all backgrounds.

Outside of my tech life, I live a vegan lifestyle, play ice hockey, and enjoy traveling the world with my wife.

If you are reading this, please watch [Dominion](https://www.dominionmovement.com/watch) and consider [going vegan](https://challenge22.com/). If you are not vegan, then you are contributing to the needless slaughter of trillions of animals per year.

We don't need to eat animals or their secretions (milk and eggs) to survive or be healthy. We don't need to experiment on them to make sure products are safe to use. We don't need to wear their skin or their fur to stay warm. Nothing can justify what we do to animals. Even if you have been tricked into believing that free-range chickens and organic grass-fed cows lived a good life, they still had to die in order to end up on your plate. How can we morally justify exploiting them when we don't need to? Is our taste worth more than their life? 

If you are feeling guilty or uneasy, I know how you feel. I felt the same way when I learned about all of the ways animals were exploited on my behalf. I found that going vegan wasn't as hard as I had thought, and by doing so, I removed the guilt from my conscious because I had aligned my actions with my values of being against animal cruelty.
