# About Me

Hi, I'm David Tang. I'm a software developer from Los Angeles working at [Oath - Verizon Digital Media Services](https://www.oath.com), building rich, client-side applications with Ember.js. I have experience on both the front-end and back-end, but my passion lies on the front-end building great user experiences. I am a proponent of test-driven development, convention over configuration, and embracing standards.

I'm the author of this blog and the book [Ember Data in the Wild](https://leanpub.com/emberdatainthewild).

I am also a part-time lecturer at the University of Southern California, [teaching web development courses](/teaching) to students from all backgrounds.

Outside of my tech life, I play ice hockey and enjoy trying new vegan restaurants and traveling the world.

If you'd like to get in touch, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iamdtang) or email me at <a href="mailto:david@thejsguy.com">david@thejsguy.com</a>.
