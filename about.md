# About Me

Hi, I'm David Tang. I'm a product-focused software engineer from Los Angeles currently working at [Verizon Media](https://www.verizonmedia.com/). My expertise is in web technologies, particularly JavaScript. I have lots of experience with Ember, Ember Data, and JSON:API. I believe in building products that deliver business value. I also value testing, convention over configuration, and embracing standards.

My passion lies on the front-end building great user experiences, but I also have professional experience on the backend working with PHP (Laravel), Node, and relational databases.

I am the author of the book [Ember Data in the Wild](https://leanpub.com/emberdatainthewild) and the SitePoint video course [Test-Driven Development in Node.js](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/master-test-driven-development-in-node-js-2932). I am also a part-time lecturer at the University of Southern California, [teaching web development courses](/teaching) to students from all backgrounds.

## Why I Went Vegan

If you are reading this, please watch [The Best Speech You Will Ever Hear by Gary Yourofsky](http://bit.ly/2ynL4Ds) and consider [trying a 21 day vegan challenge with Challenge 22](https://challenge22.com/). If you are not vegan, then you are contributing to the needless suffering, slaughter, and exploitation of trillions of animals per year.

We don't need to eat animals or their secretions (milk and eggs) to survive or be healthy. We don't need to wear their skin or fur to stay warm. Even if you were tricked into believing that free-range, cage-free, or grass-fed animals lived a good life, they were still slaughtered when they didn't want to die in order to end up on your plate. How can we morally justify exploiting and killing animals when we don't need to? Is our taste worth more than their life?

I encourage everyone to also watch [Dominion](http://bit.ly/2LSRumI). This documentary covers what animals go through because humans choose to exploit them. Many people turn away from seeing these types of videos. Before deciding not to watch this, ask yourself, if seeing how animals are raised and slaughtered isn't good enough for my eyes, how is it good enough for my stomach?

If this makes you feel sad, angry, guilty, or uncomfortable, I know how you feel. I felt the same way when I learned about all of the ways animals were exploited on my behalf. I found that going vegan wasn't as hard as I had thought, and by doing so, I cleared my conscious because I aligned my actions with my values of being against animal cruelty. I only wish I had gone vegan sooner.

This is a picture of me giving water to a pig moments before slaughter in Downtown Los Angeles at the Farmer John Slaughterhouse.

We only get away with this because everyone is prepared to look the other way. You have the power to end this.
