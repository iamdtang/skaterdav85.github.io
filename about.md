# About Me

Hi, I'm David Tang. I'm a software engineer from Los Angeles currently working at [Verizon Digital Media Services / Oath](https://www.oath.com). My expertise is in web technologies, particularly JavaScript. I have lots of experience with Ember, Ember Data, and JSON:API. I value testing and test-driven development, convention over configuration, and embracing standards.

My passion lies on the front-end building great user experiences, but I also have professional experience on the backend working with PHP, Laravel, Node, and SQL.

I'm the author of the book [Ember Data in the Wild](https://leanpub.com/emberdatainthewild) and the SitePoint video course [Test-Driven Development in Node.js](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/master-test-driven-development-in-node-js-2932).

I'm also a part-time lecturer at the University of Southern California, [teaching web development courses](/teaching) to students from all backgrounds.

Outside of my tech life, I live a vegan lifestyle, play ice hockey, and enjoy traveling the world with my wife.

If you'd like to get in touch, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iamdtang) or email me at [david@thejsguy.com](mailto:david@thejsguy.com).
