# About Me

Hi, I'm David Tang. I'm a product-focused software engineer from Los Angeles. My expertise is in web technologies, and particularly JavaScript, Ember.js, and JSON:API. I am also a part-time lecturer at the University of Southern California, [teaching web development courses](/teaching) to students from all backgrounds.

My passion lies on the front-end building great user experiences, but I also have professional experience on the backend working with PHP (primarily Laravel), Node.js, and relational databases.

## Why I Went Vegan

If you are reading this, please watch [The Best Speech You Will Ever Hear by Gary Yourofsky](http://bit.ly/2ynL4Ds). 

If you are not vegan, then you are contributing to the needless abuse of trillions of animals per year. Labels like free-range, cage-free, and grass-fed mean nothing to the animals who didn't want to die and only exist to ease your conscience when you buy animal products. 

I also encourage everyone to watch [Dominion](http://bit.ly/2LSRumI). I'm not going to lie. This documentary is dark. Before deciding not to watch this, ask yourself, if seeing how animals are raised and slaughtered isn't good enough for your eyes, how is it good enough for your stomach? Hypocrisy is closing your eyes at animal slaughter while opening your mouth at animal flesh.

If this makes you feel sad, angry, guilty, or uncomfortable, I understand how you feel. I felt similarly when I first learned about this, but what I found was that I could never justify slicing an animal's throat and stabbing them to death for a sandwich that I don't even need to eat no matter how much I like the taste. The best part about going vegan is that you no longer have to be an animal abuser or a hypocrite and you can live in alignment with the values you probably have.

This picture was taken in Downtown Los Angeles at the Farmer John Slaughterhouse moments before this pig was slaughtered. This only happens because everyone is prepared to look the other way. You have the power to end this.
