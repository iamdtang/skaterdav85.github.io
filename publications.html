        Ember Data in the Wild
      </a>
    </h2>
    <p>Have a custom API that you aren't sure how to use with Ember Data? Interested in writing your own adapter or serializer? Want to just know more about how Ember Data works? This is the Ember Data book you have been waiting for.</p>
    <p>Lots of books and tutorials start off teaching Ember with Ember Data. This is great, especially if you are in control of your API, but what if you aren't? You do a little research and start seeing terminology like adapters, serializers, transforms, and snapshots and quickly become overwhelmed. Maybe you've thought to yourself that Ember isn't for you. This was me when I first started with Ember. I wasn't in control of the APIs for my project. Well, if this sounds familiar, then this book is for you. My goal with this book is to teach you how to adapt Ember Data to fit your custom API. This book targets both Ember Data 2 and 3.</p>

        SitePoint Course: Test-Driven Development in Node.js
      </a>
    </h2>
    <p>In this course, I teach test-driven development (TDD) using practical examples. I cover a range of topics, starting with the basics of Arrange-Act-Assert, moving towards more intermediate topics including how to test asynchronous code, how to test modules that make HTTP requests, and the differences between the different types of test doubles including spies, stubs, and mocks. The last two videos in the course look at a couple alternative test frameworks. By the end of the course, you will know how to use technologies including Mocha, Chai, Sinon, Nock, Chai as Promised, Lab, Code, and Tape.</p>
