I'm excited to announce that my course [Test-Driven Development in Node.js](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/test-driven-development-in-node-js-2932/?aref=dtang) has been published on SitePoint!

In this course, I teach test-driven development (TDD) using practical examples. I cover a range of topics, starting with the basics of Arrange-Act-Assert and moving towards more intermediate and advanced topics including how to test asynchronous code, how to test modules that make HTTP requests, and the differences between the different types of test doubles including spies, stubs, and mocks. We'll finish off looking at a few alternative test frameworks.

In this course, you will learn the following technologies: Mocha, Chai, Sinon, Nock, Chai as Promised, Lab, Code, and Tape.

This week I will be giving away __3 free vouchers__ to access the course for a year. Subscribe to my newsletter below to find out more details. In the meantime, [watch the first lesson for free](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/test-driven-development-in-node-js-2932/?aref=dtang)!
