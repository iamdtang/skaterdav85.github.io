I'm excited to announce that my course [Test-Driven Development in Node.js](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/test-driven-development-in-node-js-2932/?aref=dtang) has been published on SitePoint!

In this course, I teach test-driven development (TDD) using practical examples. I cover a range of topics, starting with the basics of Arrange-Act-Assert, moving towards more intermediate topics including how to test asynchronous code, how to test modules that make HTTP requests, and the differences between the different types of test doubles including spies, stubs, and mocks. The last two videos in the course look at a couple alternative test frameworks. By the end of the course, you will know how to use technologies including Mocha, Chai, Sinon, Nock, Chai as Promised, Lab, Code, and Tape.
