Over the past year I have been working a lot with Backbone, Marionette, and Angular for various applications. With each framework though, there were definitely times where I wasn't sure what the best way to do something was and wished the framework nudged me more in particular direction. I decided to checkout [Rapid Ember.js by William Hart](http://bit.ly/1xYIVbD), a video series on Ember. Overall it was a great video series and I got out of it what I wanted. It definitely serves as a good starting point if you are wanting to learn Ember. Even though the Ember documentation is fantastic, it can still be a little overwhelming, especially when you have limited time to learn new tools and frameworks. This video course is 1 hour long and will get you up and running with Ember.

Some of the things that I really liked about the video course include:

* I like how the author explains what MVC is upfront and makes the distinction between persisted models and view models 
* i like how it explains what convention over configuration is
* embers naming conventions for both routes and nested routes and the associated controllers, views, and template names
* i like the overview of ember data in section 2 and they explain what an adapter is and how it fits in with models, the store, and the data source
