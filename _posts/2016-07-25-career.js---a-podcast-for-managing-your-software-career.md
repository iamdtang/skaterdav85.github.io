I still remember what it felt like being a new developer trying to get my first job. I had lots of questions like, "Should I go back to college and get a CS degree?", "Should I work for a startup or an established company?", "Do I need to know algorithms to become a web developer?", "What technologies should I focus on?", and many more. I didn't have very many people to ask these questions, so I just figured it out for myself. Getting my first job was tough, but each job after that became easier and easier, and now, I no longer have doubts about being in the web development industry.

Today, I'm excited to announce the [CareerJS podcast](http://careerjs.com/) that I am co-hosting with my two buddies [Jeffrey Biles](https://twitter.com/JeffreyBiles) and [Erik Hanchett](https://twitter.com/ErikCH), where we help you navigate your software career. Whether you are brand new to the industry or you have some experience under your belt, there's something for everyone. I don't have my career completely figured out. I still have questions myself, but things are much, much better than they were 8 years ago when I first started, and hopefully our discussions and interviews can help you.
