Since I last wrote this post, my thoughts on testing components with both unit and integration tests have changed, and I no longer recommend writing unit tests for components. Components are a lot like functions, where the inputs are the attributes and the output is DOM. That is more representative of the component's public API as opposed to the instance variables on the component. I think treating a few instance properties on a component as public API and writing assertions against that is fine and can be useful. The problem I've seen is when newer developers see these types of tests and aren't familiar with privacy and start testing every property on a component with a unit test. This makes it difficult to change the internals of a component without having to update several unit tests despite the component's behavior staying the same.

If the data manipulation for a component is complex enough where it becomes difficult to write an integration test, I instead recommend promoting that logic to a separate class or function (service or utility) which can be unit tested in isolation and having the component consume that. This way you're less likely to end up with a component unit test that tests a lot of private implementation details. I was tempted to delete this post, but I figured sharing my new thoughts on this subject would be useful for anyone who lands on it. ðŸ™‚

In this post, we'll look at how integration tests can be used in conjunction with unit tests to effectively test different aspects of your Ember components.

When you generate an Ember component, Ember CLI also creates a corresponding integration test. Integration tests allow you to invoke the component as you would in your templates with the necessary data and write assertions against the resulting DOM using jQuery.

Let's create a `cat-list` component:

```
ember g component cat-list
```

The template for this component looks like this:

```html
{% raw %}
{{#each cats as |cat|}}
  <div class="cat">
    <span>Name:</span>
    <span>{{cat.name}}</span>
    <span>Age:</span>
    <span>{{cat.age}}</span>
  </div>
{{/each}}
{% endraw %}
```

Here is an integration test for this component:

```js
// tests/integration/components/cat-list-test.js
{% raw %}
test('it renders all cats', function(assert) {
  this.set('cats', [
    { name: 'Tubby', age: 9 },
    { name: 'Spot', age: 8 },
    { name: 'Chester', age: 11 },
    { name: 'Frisky', age: 3 }
  ]);

  this.render(hbs`{{cat-list cats=cats}}`);
  assert.equal(this.$('.cat').length, 4);
});
{% endraw %}
```

This test simply asserts that all 4 cats were rendered. Now imagine in this `cat-list` component that you have a computed property called `sortedCats` that contains a list of cats sorted by their age. The template now changes to:

```html
{% raw %}
{{#each sortedCats as |cat|}}
  <div class="cat">
    <span>Name:</span>
    <span>{{cat.name}}</span>
    <span>Age:</span>
    <span>{{cat.age}}</span>
  </div>
{{/each}}
{% endraw %}
```

How would you go about testing that the cats are sorted by their age? One way to test this is through an integration test, where you write assertions against the DOM to verify that the cats are sorted. For example:

```js
// tests/integration/components/cat-list-test.js
{% raw %}
test('it renders all cats sorted by their age', function(assert) {
  this.set('cats', [
    { name: 'Tubby', age: 9 },
    { name: 'Spot', age: 8 },
    { name: 'Chester', age: 11 },
    { name: 'Frisky', age: 3 }
  ]);

  this.render(hbs`{{cat-list cats=cats}}`);
  let $cats = this.$('.cat');

  assert.equal($cats.eq(0).find('span').eq(1).text().trim(), 'Frisky');
  assert.equal($cats.eq(1).find('span').eq(1).text().trim(), 'Spot');
  assert.equal($cats.eq(2).find('span').eq(1).text().trim(), 'Tubby');
  assert.equal($cats.eq(3).find('span').eq(1).text().trim(), 'Chester');
});
{% endraw %}
```

This can be a little cumbersome, especially when the HTML becomes more complicated. You basically have to go through the DOM and see what was rendered in order to make assertions against the data.

Instead, another approach is to test the computed property itself in a unit test.

To generate a unit test for a component, run:

```
ember g component-test cat-list -unit
```

To unit test the `sortedCats` computed property, we can do the following:

```js
// tests/unit/components/cat-list-test.js
test('sortedCats contains the cats sorted by age', function(assert) {
  let component = this.subject();
  component.set('cats', [
    { name: 'Tubby', age: 9 },
    { name: 'Spot', age: 8 },
    { name: 'Chester', age: 11 },
    { name: 'Frisky', age: 3 }
  ]);

  assert.deepEqual(component.get('sortedCats'), [
    { name: 'Frisky', age: 3 },
    { name: 'Spot', age: 8 },
    { name: 'Tubby', age: 9 },
    { name: 'Chester', age: 11 }
  ]);
});
```

Although this sorting example isn't very complex, testing more complicated data manipulations can be a little easier this way. This approach has some drawbacks though. If multiple properties are tested this way, the component's internals can become difficult to change without having to update several unit tests.

One thing to note about unit testing components is that the tests don't wire up dependencies for you. If you have nested components within your component, you will need to add those to the `needs` property in your setup, unlike with a component integration test. For example, if each cat were rendered in a `rescued-cat` component, `moduleForComponent` would need to look like this:

```js
moduleForComponent('cat-list', 'Unit | Component | cat list', {
  // Specify the other units that are required for this test
  needs: ['component:rescued-cat'],
  unit: true
});
```

## Conclusion

When it comes to testing components, I start off writing integration tests. When I want to test more complex data manipulation, like computed properties that sort or filter data, then I sometimes find it useful to write a component unit test as well.
