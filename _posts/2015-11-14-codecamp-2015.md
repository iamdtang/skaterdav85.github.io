date:   2015-11-14
description: This session will introduce you to Ember, a framework for building ambitious web applications. You will build an application using Ember 2 and its companion command line utility Ember CLI. We'll use the power of Ember Data to work with an API and learn how it can be adapted for any backend. We'll also look at the philosophies that drive the framework including convention over configuration and stability without stagnation. This presentation will be hands on.
