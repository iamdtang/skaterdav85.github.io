The midterm will be an in-class practical where you will build a web app using React in 2.5 hours based on some requirements I give you using things you learned in the weeks leading up to the exam. You can use previous assignments, notes, and the internet to look things up. You are __NOT ALLOWED__ to communicate with anyone in or outside of class by any means. To study, review assigned readings and your past assignments and labs.

## Submission

When you are finished, deploy your project to Surge and include a link to your Surge URL in the README.md of your repo. 

Submit your midterm [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/fj_0NO_U) on our GitHub classroom. Failure to submit by the deadline will result in a 0.
