The midterm will be an in-class practical where you will build a web app using React in 2.5 hours based on requirements I give you using things you learned in the weeks leading up to the exam. You can use previous assignments, notes, and the internet to look things up. You are __NOT ALLOWED__ to communicate with anyone in or outside of class by any means. To study, review assigned readings and your past assignments and labs.
