title: Database Research
---

In preparation for next week's guest lecture, do some research on the differences between relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases. Create a publicly accessible Google Doc and explain in your own words the tradeoffs between these two types of databases. Also document some examples of each type of database.

Your explanation should be in your own words. If it looks like you copied text from the internet, you will get a 0.

## Submission

Email your publicly accessible Google Doc link to the TA and myself with the subject line __Lab 6: Database Research__. This lab is due __before class next week__.
