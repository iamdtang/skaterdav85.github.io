Create a repo with a README.md file. Perform some research on the [JSON:API specification](https://jsonapi.org/) and answer the following questions in your own words in the README.md using Markdown.

1. What is JSON:API and why was it created?
1. Are there any alternatives to JSON:API? If so, please specify.
1. What are the pros and cons of JSON:API?
1. Make up an endpoint and its data and model it as JSON:API. Your example should be different from the one on the [JSON:API site](https://jsonapi.org/). Your example should have at least 1 relationship. Write your example JSON in a [code block](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).
