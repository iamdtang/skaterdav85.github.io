Fetch and render repos using the "getRepos()" function in the App.js component. When the data is being fetched, show the Loading component. For each repo, display the following properties:

* name
* description
* if "archived" is true, show the text "Archived". otherwise, show the text "Active".

Create a component called GitHubRepoCard for each repo.
