For this assignment, you will modify Assignment 3 so that it is more interactive. Please use the same repository.

## Search Bar

Add a search bar at the top of the page. The search bar should contain a text input and a submit button. The search bar is for users to type in a subreddit topic. When the search form is submitted, the app will fetch the data and render it on the page. The app should display a loading indicator while the page is loading. Also, unlike the class example, make it so that while a search is processing, the search bar remains rendered on the page and the loading indicator is beneath it.

## Previous Search History

Add a feature that keeps track of all previous searches and display them somewhere on the page. Make it such that a user can click on one of the previous searches and the app fetches and renders the data for that search term.

## Read Count

Add a feature that tracks every time a post is clicked regardless if it is the same post. This total can be rendered anywhere on the page and should start at 0. This number will reset back to 0 when the page reloads.

## Submission

You can push the code to the same repo as Assignment 3. Also, deploy your updated app to Surge. Send an email to the TA and me with the title "ITP 404 - Assignment 4" with the GitHub and Surge URLs in the body. Failure to submit by the deadline will result in a 0.
