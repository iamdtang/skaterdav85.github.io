For this assignment, you will modify Assignment 3 so that it is more interactive. Please use the same repository.

## Search Bar

First, add a search bar at the top of the page. The search bar should contain a text input and a submit button. The search bar should allow for users to type in a subreddit topic. When the search form is submitted, the app will fetch the data and render it on the page. The app should display a loading indicator while the page is loading.

## Read Count

Add a feature that tracks every time a post is clicked regardless if it is the same post. This total should be at the top of the page somewhere and should start at 0. This number will reset back to 0 when the page reloads.

## Submission

You can push the code to the same repo as Assignment 3. Also, deploy your updated app to Surge. Send an email to the TA and me with the title "ITP 404 - Assignment 4" with the GitHub and Surge URLs in the body. Failure to submit by the deadline will result in a 0.
