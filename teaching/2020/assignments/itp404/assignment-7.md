For this assignment, you will write tests [for a sample application](https://github.com/ITP-Solutions/assignment-7-starter).

Download the code for this repo. Fill in the empty tests in all files that end with `.test.js`. All your tests should pass. When you are finished, take a screenshot of your terminal and display the image on the README. [Check out this resource on how to create an image in Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images-1).
