title: Relational vs. Non-relational Database Research
---

In preparation for next week's guest lecture, do some research on the differences between relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases. Create a repo with a README.md file. In that file, and explain in your own words the tradeoffs between these two types of databases. Also, include a list of a few SQL and NoSQL databases out there.
