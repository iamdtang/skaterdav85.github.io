title: Build a Reusable Component
---

For this lab, you will build a reusable component of your choice. Take a look at web applications that you use and see what user interface elements might make for a good reusable component.

If you can't think of a reusable component to build, here are some ideas:

- A modal
- An accordion
- A tooltip
- A Delete button that shows an inline Confirm Delete button when clicked. You could also enhance this so that users must type in a specific string before Confirm Delete becomes enabled. For example, try deleting a repo on GitHub.
- Tabs with panels
- A sortable table
- A checkbox list
- A file tree

Your reusable component should provide some flexibility as to what HTML is rendered through a render prop.

Create a page that demos this component. In the README of your repo, show a code sample in a [fenced code block](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) and write about your motivations and design decisions for this component.

## Deploy to Netlify or Surge

Deploy your project to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or Surge. Here are instructions for [Deploying React Projects to Surge.sh](/2019/10/17/deploying-react-to-surge.html). Add the deployed URL to your `README.md` using a Markdown link. See this [Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to learn how to create a link in Markdown.
