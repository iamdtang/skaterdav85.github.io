[VIEW MIDTERM HERE](https://gist.github.com/skaterdav85/c8a1440117ecdd82ec725a7e94b0499d)

The midterm will be an in-class practical where you will build a web application using React in 3 hours based on requirements I give you using the material that we have covered in the weeks leading up to the exam. You can use previous assignments, notes, assignment solutions, and the internet to look things up. You are **NOT ALLOWED** to communicate with anyone in or outside of class by any means. To study, review the additional resources, your past assignments and labs, assignment solutions, and class demos.

## What You Don't Need To Study

- The APIs we've worked with
- Handlebars
- Event Delegation
- DOMPurify
- JSON Server

## What You Should Study

- Promises
- React and React Router
- Making Ajax calls with `fetch()`
- The following Array methods: `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `find`, `join`, and `concat`

I recommend reviewing past assignments and solutions, class demos, and the Promise slides.

## Deploy to Netlify or Surge

- Deploy your project to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or Surge. Here are instructions for [Deploying React Projects to Surge.sh](/2019/10/17/deploying-react-to-surge.html).
- Add the deployed URL to your `README.md` using a Markdown link. See this [Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to learn how to create a link in Markdown.

Feel free to scaffold the project and deploy to Netlify or Surge before the midterm date, so that during the exam, all you will have to do is `git commit` and `git push`. I highly encourage doing this to save time during the exam.
