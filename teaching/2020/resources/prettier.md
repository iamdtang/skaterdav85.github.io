[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter which will automatically format your code when you save files. Please install a Prettier plugin for whatever editor or IDE you will be using. If you are using VS Code like me, do the following:

1. Go to `Code > Preferences > Extensions`. Search for "Prettier". Click "Install" for the top result, which should have the highest download count. You may need to restart VS Code.
1. Open a `.js` file and save it to test it out. You will likely see that your file was reformatted.

If you aren't using VS Code, check out the [Editor Integration page](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html).

Prettier offers some flexibility if you want it to format your code a certain way. For example, you can configure Prettier to use single quotes instead of double quotes. Check out the [Configuration page](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html) for more information.
