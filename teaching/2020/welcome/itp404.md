title: Welcome to ITP 404!

Hello everyone!

Welcome to ITP 404 - Advanced Front-End Web Development! In order for us to hit the ground running on the first day of class, I want to take care of most administrative items and environment setup beforehand.

The class page is [https://davidtang.io/teaching/2020/itp404](/teaching/2020/itp404). Blackboard will only be used for grades. We will use Slack to communicate. You should have received an invitation in your email to join the class workspace. Please [join the workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/itp404fall2020/shared_invite/zt-ff7af9lj-OU6zYnrYbpRm5g43hHUuPQ), upload a picture of yourself, and update your name to how you would like to be addressed.

I have updated the syllabus on the [Schedule of Classes](https://classes.usc.edu/term-20203/classes/itp/) to account for the Fall semester changes.

## Git and GitHub

In this course, we will be using Git, GitHub, and GitHub Classroom for labs, assignments, the midterm, the final project, and class demos. If you aren't familiar with Git and GitHub, please check out the following courses on LinkedIn Learning, which you should have access to as a USC student:

- [Git Essential Training: The Basics](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/git-essential-training-the-basics/use-git-version-control-software-to-manage-project-code?u=76870426)
- [Learning Git and GitHub](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-git-and-github/welcome?u=76870426)

What I'd like you to be comfortable with before class is the following:

- Creating a Git repository (`git init`)
- Staging files (`git add`)
- Making commits (`git commit -m 'Some message'`)
- Pushing your local repository to a remote repository (`git push`)
- `.gitignore` files

Learning Git does involve working with the command line (CLI). I have created a [Command Line Basics](/teaching/2020/resources/command-line-basics) resource that may help if you need to review the common commands.

If you have any questions along the way, don't hesitate to reach out! Learning Git can feel pretty intimidating.

## Development Environment Setup

1. I will be using [Visual Studio Code (often referred to as VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as my editor, but you are welcome to use whatever editor / IDE that you like.
1. [Set up Prettier](/teaching/2020/resources/prettier).
1. [Install Node.js](/teaching/2020/resources/installing-node). Even if you have Node.js installed, you might find this resource helpful.
1. If you don't already have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, please create one.
1. If you don't already have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed, please install it.
1. (Optional) I will be using Git from the command line (CLI), but some students in the past have found the [GitHub GUI](https://desktop.github.com/) to be helpful. This might be helpful for those who are less comfortable with the command line.
1. Read about [submitting work through GitHub Classroom](/teaching/2020/resources/github-classroom).

Please reach out to me on Slack if you have any questions. See everyone on Tuesday, August 18th at 5pm! üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª
