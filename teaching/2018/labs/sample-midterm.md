### Client-side Templating

Download the [starter files](/teaching/2018/midterm-starter.zip).

Make an Ajax request to [this endpoint](https://thejsguy.com/teaching/2018/api/restaurants.json) and render the array of restaurants in the `data` attribute using client-side templating with Handlebars.js. Display all attributes of each restaurant. The `ownedBy` attribute should be rendered as an unordered list. The `yelpPage` attribute should be rendered as a link that opens in a new tab. The text of this link should say "Check us out on Yelp". If the restaurant accepts Apple Pay, display an Apple icon. Otherwise, display the text "No Apple Pay". While the response is loading, display "Loading...".
