Create a new Ember application. Delete the contents in the README and write a paragraph about your application addressing the following questions:

1. What problem are you trying to solve?
2. Who is the primary audience?
3. How will the [project requirements](/teaching/2018/itp404-final-project) be fulfilled?
4. Which addon(s) do you think you will use and for what? Explore Ember addons at [Ember Observer](https://www.emberobserver.com/).

## Project Ideas From Last Semester

### Coffee, Now!

http://coffee-now.surge.sh/

Coffee Now is a web app used to find coffee shops open now near you.

### Favorite Restaurants

http://kunal-itp404.surge.sh/

If you have a multitude of restaurants on your to-try list, its hard to know if youâ€™re close to one unless you happen to remember where it is. With my application, you will be able to see all the restaurants you want to try on a convenient map so you can see if you happen to be close to one when you are out and about.

### A News Site

http://worldly.surge.sh

People who want to be educated in the news about different topics and areas; readers of the New York Times.

Addressing the problem that people are often constrained to only a few topics about only the United States. My project will show headlines from the New York Times through a worldwide perspective regarding different subjects.

### Multi-Source Web Setlists

http://setlistxyz.surge.sh/

Every weekend, I hold a DJ show at KXSC, the student radio station on campus. When I build setlists for the 2-hour show, I generally pull from many sources - Soundcloud and Bandcamp URLs, my personal iTunes library, Spotify and Apple Music, raw audio files of unreleased tracks, illicitly uploaded YouTube videos, non-illicitly uploaded YouTube videos, etc.

To do this, I usually put together a text document listing track metadata and either a URL if the song is hosted online or the location/application where I can find it if not. During the actual show, I output all the show audio from my laptop, manually loading up audio sources, taking care to mute tabs to avoid autoplay leaking in, carefully timing for good track spacing, making things not sound too sudden because I can't crossfade... This is a bit of a drag, and very inefficient.

What I'd prefer instead, and I'll try to build here, is a tool that integrates with the APIs of major streaming sites and web audio standards to automatically play through a setlist built from web sources, potentially including those with user authentication, and perhaps temporarily uploaded user audio files.

These playlists can be built, including metadata, within the site, saved to the server for recall, and potentially shared with a short link.

This tool is primarily for my own use, but, ideally, other DJs at the station could also use it to organize their shows.


## Submission

Create a repo on Github called __itp404-final-project__ and push up your project. Send an email to the TA and myself with the Github URL.
