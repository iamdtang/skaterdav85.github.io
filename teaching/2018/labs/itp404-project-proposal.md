Create a new Ember application. Delete the contents in the README and write a paragraph about your application addressing the following questions:

1. What problem are you trying to solve?
2. Who is the primary audience?
3. How will the [project requirements](/teaching/2018/itp404-final-project) be fulfilled?
4. Which addon(s) do you think you will use and for what? Explore Ember addons at [Ember Observer](https://www.emberobserver.com/).

## Submission

Create a repo on Github called __itp404-final-project__ and push up your project. Send an email to the TA and myself with the Github URL.
