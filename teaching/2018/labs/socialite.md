Revisit your Laravel application and implement Socialite using one of the supported providers that we didn't cover in class. Your application should be able to login via another provider, similar to the example we did in class.

## Submission

Please push up your code to the same Laravel repository (__itp405-laravel-assignments__). You should already have connected your GitHub repository to Heroku for automatic deployments. If you haven't, [follow these instructions](/tutorials/deploying-laravel-with-sqlite-to-heroku). Verify that your app has been deployed and it works on Heroku. Send an email to me and the TA with the repository URL and the URL to the live site on Heroku.
