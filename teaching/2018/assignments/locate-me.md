For this assignment, you will build an app that plots a marker on a Google Map for your current location. When the marker is clicked, an info window should open up showing the approximate address of your location.

First you will need to get your current location in latitude and longitude the geolocation API built into the browser.

Once you have a latitude and longitude, use the Google Maps API to reverse geocode the coordinates into an approximate address.

## An Extra Challenge (Optional)

If you're up for it, look through the Google Maps API documentation to find out how to use a custom image for a map marker.

## Submission

Create a repo on Github called __itp404-assignment3__ and upload your files. Send an email to the TA and myself with the Github URL. As always, assignments are due the following Tuesday at midnight.
