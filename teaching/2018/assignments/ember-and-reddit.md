In this lab, you will build an Ember app where you render the following API:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript.json](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript.json)

Show the following fields in a presentable way:

* num_comments
* ups
* downs
* title
* domain

## The Application Template

Create some sort of page header and footer in the application template.

## Loading

While the Ajax request is pending, show some sort of loading indicator on the screen using Ember's loading substate template. This could be as simple as "Loading..." or [one of these cool CSS spinners](https://projects.lukehaas.me/css-loaders/).
